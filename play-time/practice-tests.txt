*************************Question 1**********************************
Upgrade the current version of kubernetes from 1.30.0 to 1.31.0 exactly using the kubeadm utility. 
Make sure that the upgrade is carried out one node at a time starting with the controlplane node. 
To minimize downtime, the deployment gold-nginx should be rescheduled on an alternate node before 
upgrading each node.


Upgrade controlplane node first and drain node node01 before upgrading it. Pods for gold-nginx should 
run on the controlplane node subsequently.

Cluster Upgraded?

pods 'gold-nginx' running on controlplane?

*************************Question 2**********************************
Print the names of all deployments in the admin2406 namespace in the following format:

DEPLOYMENT   CONTAINER_IMAGE   READY_REPLICAS   NAMESPACE

<deployment name>   <container image used>   <ready replica count>   <Namespace>
. The data should be sorted by the increasing order of the deployment name.


Example:

DEPLOYMENT   CONTAINER_IMAGE   READY_REPLICAS   NAMESPACE
deploy0   nginx:alpine   1   admin2406
Write the result to the file /opt/admin2406_data.

*************************Question 3**********************************
A kubeconfig file called admin.kubeconfig has been created in /root/CKA. There is something wrong with 
the configuration. Troubleshoot and fix it.


Fix /root/CKA/admin.kubeconfig

*************************Question 4**********************************
Create a new deployment called nginx-deploy, with image nginx:1.16 and 1 replica.
Next, upgrade the deployment to version 1.17 using rolling update and add the annotation message
Updated nginx image to 1.17.


Image: nginx:1.16

Task: Upgrade the version of the deployment to 1:17

*************************Question 5**********************************
A new deployment called alpha-mysql has been deployed in the alpha namespace. However, the pods are 
not running. Troubleshoot and fix the issue. The deployment should make use of the persistent volume 
alpha-pv to be mounted at /var/lib/mysql and should use the environment variable 
MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=1 to make use of an empty root password.

Important: Do not alter the persistent volume.

Troubleshoot and fix the issues

*************************Question 6**********************************
Take the backup of ETCD at the location /opt/etcd-backup.db on the controlplane node.


Troubleshoot and fix the issues


*************************Question 7**********************************

Create a pod called secret-1401 in the admin1401 namespace using the busybox image. The container within the pod should be called secret-admin and should sleep for 4800 seconds.

The container should mount a read-only secret volume called secret-volume at the path /etc/secret-volume. The secret being mounted has already been created for you and is called dotfile-secret.


Pod created correctly?
