controlplane /tmp ✖ kubectl apply -f /tmp/kubectl-edit-3319683989.yaml

2) getting connection to mysql refused from app
* mysql service was was confirgured with wrong target port
* kubectl edit svc mysql-service -n beta -> change to correct taget port 3306
*** end point has port in it now

6) cannot reach webapp ui
* using wrong node port in webapp-service
